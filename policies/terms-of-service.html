          <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>

            ("TRUESIP," "we," "us," or "our"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service
            ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use our services.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Service Description</h2>
          <p>
            TRUESIP provides wholesale voice termination services to qualified carriers, VoIP
            providers, and enterprise networks. Services are provided on a business-to-business
            basis and are not available to end consumers.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>

          <h2>4. Service Agreement</h2>
          <p>
            Use of TRUESIP services requires execution of a separate service agreement. These Terms
            supplement, but do not replace, the service agreement. In case of conflict, the service
            agreement prevails.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Payment Terms</h2>
          <p>
            Payment terms are specified in the service agreement. Failure to pay amounts due may
            result in service suspension or termination. You are responsible for all taxes, fees,
            and charges associated with your use of services.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Service Quality and Availability</h2>
          <p>
            While we strive for high service quality and availability, TRUESIP does not guarantee
            uninterrupted or error-free service. We reserve the right to perform maintenance and
            make changes to our network infrastructure.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>
            TRUESIP's liability is limited as specified in the service agreement. In no event shall
            TRUESIP be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising
            from your use of our services.
          </p>

          <h2>8. Indemnification</h2>
          <p>
            You agree to indemnify and hold harmless TRUESIP from claims, damages, and expenses
            arising from your violation of these Terms, applicable laws, or third-party rights.
          </p>

          <h2>9. Termination</h2>
          <p>
            Either party may terminate services as specified in the service agreement. TRUESIP may
            immediately suspend or terminate services for violations of these Terms or the
            Acceptable Use Policy.
          </p>

          <h2>10. Dispute Resolution</h2>

          <p>
            TRUESIP may modify these Terms at any time. Material changes will be communicated via
            email. Continued use of services after changes constitutes acceptance.
